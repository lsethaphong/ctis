!======================================================================
! sps_pHXV is a specialized version of the sps_HXV function for sparse
! matrix (column compressed, row successive form) and a non compressed
! full element addressable vector
! The resultant data file is uncompressed and is a portion of the
! object vector: It is partitioned as length(f)/num_processors 
! a row corresponds to a particular voxel element of the object vector
! will use this function to generate an estimate of f
